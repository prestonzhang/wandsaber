			<h1>Welcome to Wand-Saber!</h1>
			<p>A novel by Caroline and Preston Zhang, combining their loves for Harry Potter and Star Wars.</p> 
			<p>Enjoy! WELCOME... to Wand Saber! We had the idea of Wand Saber when we were going out for a walk. We thought it would be nice to write a story so we decided we would mix up STAR WARS and HARRY POTTER. This is because we both liked adventures and those two moives were our favorite moives that had adventures in them. Please love WAND SABER as much as we do!</a></p>
